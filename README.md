# Project Checkpoint 1 - Software Requirements

Submit these Requirements documents for your project:

## 1. Description of features

This document describes the features of the software product. It should not be just a list of features. It should
briefly describe each feature in a comprehensive way so that a reader can imagine what he/she can do or how can he/she
interact with the software.

Format: **docx**

## 2. Use cases

Follow [provided template](https://lms.fit.hanu.vn/pluginfile.php/21986/mod_assign/intro/Use%20Case%20Template.docx).
Use cases should be expressed in a comprehensive way, with consistent names and IDs, with all the possible alternatives
and exceptions.

Format: **docx**

## 3. Use case diagrams

This diagram shows all actors and use cases of the system, along with the system boundary. All use cases and their
relationships should be clearly illustrated.

Format: PDF or PNG file with *high/decent picture quality*

## 4. Activity diagrams

An activity diagram visually describes a use case. Activity diagram is a good way to illustrate the flows and all the
possible paths of an use case (including normal flow, alternatives and exceptions).

Format: PDF or PNG file with *high/decent picture quality*

Recommendation:

- Use diagrams.net to draw
- Turn off grids and zoom the page as big as possible before taking screenshots
- Create PDF from screenshots or just save them under PNG format

## 5. E-R diagrams or database design with relationships

It is necessary to show the entities in the system, their relationships and cardinalities.

Format: PDF or PNG with *high/decent picture quality*

## How progress check will be conducted

In tutorial class, each team leader shows teacher what the team have done and who've done each part. Teacher sees the
amount and quality of work and ask questions if necessary. If we don't have enough time on tutorial, it's fine, we'll
check your submitted files later.

## Notes

In this checkpoint, students submit what you currently have with the project. Some documents can be in the early
version. They can be further modified during system development.
